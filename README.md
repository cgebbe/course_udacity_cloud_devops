## AWS access

You are given a federated user account, a temporary AWS user account with limited permissions, that you can use in this program. You can open it from within Udacity by clicking on "Open AWS Gateway". Relevant notes:
- The time per session is limited
- The AWS region can be changed (from default us-east-1)
- The budget is 75$ (usually 20$ suffices). Therefore, make sure to shut down the resources!
