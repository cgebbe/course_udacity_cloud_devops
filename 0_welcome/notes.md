# Welcome

- [your code is a crime scene](https://www.amazon.de/dp/B00ZB5XWBI/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)
  - recommended, but poor reception on amazon
- [ELSA (Event, Language, Structure, Agency) **change** model](https://dromologue.com/elsa/)
  - on how to drive change
  - see e.g. https://en.innova1st.com/2019/05/12/the-best-kept-secret-by-successful-change-consultants-the-elsa-change-framework-part-2/
- how to approach problems and solutions
  - start with problem (e.g. defects in production)
  - propose a solution (e.g. increase test coverage)
  - hypothezie outcome (e.g. defect will be lowered by 5%)
  - implement, **measure result** and review
    - have defects been lowered?
    - "data-driven approach"
- Antipattern: Hire (external) DevOps team.
  - This doesn't work because...
    - team doesn't know problem
    - people who know problem don't know how to solve it
  - Instead, rather
    - partner with developers
    - upskill developer
